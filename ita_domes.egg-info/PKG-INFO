# ita-domes

This package contains a simulation tool for Italian residential building stock.

## How to install

The installation follows three steps:

1. As first step, you must create a new conda or venv environment. You can name it gtenv.

`conda create -n gtenv`

and activate it:

`conda activate gtenv`

2. As second step, install the libraries listed in the requirements file.

`pip install -r venv/requirements.txt`


3. Since the simulation relies on EUReCA, you need to install it inside `gtenv` as explained [here](https://github.com/BETALAB-team/EUReCA/tree/main).


## How to use

You can find the documentation on how to use the tool by opening two files locally with your browser:
1. A quick guide to start : `docs/quickstart.html` 
2. The full documentation : `docs/manual.html` .

## How to cite

It will be updated when we'll have a publication.
